# I am here since ruff's isort of imports requires directory with ruff.toml
# to be a python package and, therefore, contain __init__.py
# This conflicts with pytest path resolution in case of src layout project structure
# Therefore, we extend root ruff.toml to allow for proper test execution and import resolution
